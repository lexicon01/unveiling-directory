    <h1>A Searchable, Browsable, Hierarchical Unordered List of Links</h1>
    <p>This is a unordered list of links, organized into categories. Using the list and accessing the links works in two
        ways:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Browse Mode</b>: clicking on a category name reveals the links in that category along with any
            sub-categories.</li>
        <li><b>Search Mode</b>: entering one or more space-separated terms in the search input field will result in a
            display of all the links that match the terms provided. The search matches against the link names and link
            descriptions.</li>
    </ol>
